    "description": "Each IMPC gene knockout strain is assessed for viability by examination of litters produced from mating heterozygous animals. A strain is declared lethal if no homozygous nulls pups are detected at weaning age. A strain is declared subviable if homozygous null pups constitute less than 12.5% of the litter. For lethal strains, embryos are phenotyped in the embryonic and perinatal lethal pipeline. For embryonic lethal and subviable strains, heterozygotes are phenotyped in the IMPC adult phenotyping pipeline.",
