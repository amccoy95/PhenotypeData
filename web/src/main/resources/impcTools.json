IMPReSS contains definitions of the phenotyping Pipelines and mandatory and optional Procedures and Parameters carried out and data collected by international mouse clinics following the protocols defined. This allows data to be comparable and shareable and ontological annotations permit interspecies comparison which may help in the identification of phenotypic mouse-models of human diseases.",
