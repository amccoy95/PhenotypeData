                            <h3>Explore the diverse entry points to mouse phenotype data.</h3>
							Currently, the IMPC portal supports 6 main datatypes on the search page:
							Genes, Phenotypes, Diseases, Anatomy, Impc Images, and legacy Images.<br>
							Each main datatype has filters to allow for data filtering.<p>
                            <img src='img/search-main-data-type.png' /><p>

                            <div>Clicking on a main datatype tab under the main input box on top of the search page (eg, Genes, Phenotypes, Diseases) without ticking its filter(s) (in left side panel) will display all records of that datatype.
                            The screenshot above shows the total number of genes in the portal.<p><p></p>

                            Depending on the datatype, the filters will be changed dynamically.<br>

                            <h6>Filter control and behavior</h6>
                            <div>You are in control of whether a filter is open or closed by ticking on it.<p>
                                When a filter is checked (ie, ticking on the checkbox), the result counts will change dynamically. The counts of non-matching filters will become zero and disabled (grayed out) and when you hover over them, a no-entry sign will appear indicating that that filter is now unclickable until it matches other filter combinations.
                            </div>

                        </div><br>
                            A table explaining each filter will be provided for each datatype described below.<p></p>

                                You can select the desired term by using the UP/DOWN keys or by selecting the term with the mouse and pressing the ENTER key.<p></p><p></p>

                            <h4>IMPC Image Search</h4>

                            Currently, there are two major types of images. The "IMPC images" (the IMPC Images datatype) and the legacy ones (the Images datatype).<br>
                            The Images datatype is legacy data from previous Europhenome/Eumodic phenotyping projects.<br><br>

                            As both datatypes can be searched by similar interfaces, the document here refers to the "IMPC Images" datatype.<br><br>

                            <div>First, click on the "IMPC Images" datatype tab. It will show all images that IMPC knows about if no filters are ticked on the left panel.<br>
                            You could enter a mouse anatomy ID/name or procedure name from IMPReSS into the main input box and/or click on a filter on the left panel to narrow down your result to relevant IMPC images.<br>
                            IMPReSS contains standardized phenotyping protocols essential for the characterization of mouse phenotypes.<br><br>
                            <p>The screenshot below shows searching the IMPC Images datatype with the mouse anatomy term "trunk":<br>
                        </div><br>

                            There are two ways to view images data: Annotation View and Image View.<br>
                            The former groups images by annotations which can be genes, anatomy terms (MA) or procedures. The latter lists annotations (genes, MA and procedure) to an image.<br><br>


                    <h6 id="quick-image-search">Annotation View (default)</h6>
                    <img src='img/quick-img-search-annotView.png' /><br>


                    <h6 id="quick-image-search-image-view">Image View</h6>
                    <p>To list annotations to an image, simply click on the "Show Image View" link in the top-right corner of the results grid. The label of the same link will then change to "Show Annotation View" so that you can toggle the views.</p><br>
