This page is separated into different subsections which are highlighted on the screenshot below.
<ul class="subUl">
    <li>Search box (see below for more information)</li>
    <li>Datatype subsection<br>
   Currently, the IMPC portal supports 6 main datatypes on the search page: Genes, Phenotypes, Diseases, Anatomy, Impc Images, and legacy Images.
Each main datatype has filters to allow for data filtering. The selected one is highlighted in dark blue. The ones w/o results will be grayed out.</li>
    <li>Filter subsection<br>
The user is in control of whether a filter is open or closed by ticking on it.
Filter options will change according to datatypes and will dynamically count data corresponding to user's filtering choice. The counts of non-matching filters will become zero and disabled (grayed out).
    </li>
    <li>Results subsection</li>

      <h4 id="autosuggest_srch">Search box: more information on Auto-suggest support</h4>
      <p>Enter at least 3 letters to invoke a drop-down list of terms related to your search keyword. The results will be prefixed by a datatype which are described in the table below. The top ten most relevant terms will be shown, in order of relevance scores. You can select the desired term by using the UP/DOWN keys or by selecting the term with the mouse and pressing the ENTER key.

      <h4>Keyword search and datatype</h4><p class="intraSectBr"></p>
      When a main datatype is chosen (Genes, Phenotypes, Diseases, Anatomy), typing a keyword in the main input box and hit ENTER w/o choosing an item from the dropdown list will show the result with the same main datatype selected.
      However, when you specifically choose an item from the dropdown list, the selected datatype will be the one associated with the selected item.
    <p class="intraSectBr"></p>

      The table shows the possible datatypes currently searchable.
