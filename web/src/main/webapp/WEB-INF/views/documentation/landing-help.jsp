<h3 id="explore">Landing Page</h3>
<p>The IMPC is capturing a broad, complex suite of phenotype data across biological systems for both embryonic and adult knockout mice. To address specific communities,
IMPC informatics is developing specialised landing pages that highlight relevant data. The first of these is for embryonic phenotyping with other pages planned for the
vision, auditory, cardiovascular, metabolism and bone/cartilage research communities.
</p>

<h4 id="embryo">Embryo Phenotyping landing page</h4>
<p>The embryo phenotype landing page is available <a href="${baseUrl}/embryo">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
This page summarises the different types of embryonic phenotype data being collected by the IMPC community and is organised into modules. 
</p>

<h4 id="viability">Viability module</h4>
<p>The first module contains a graphical summary of the viability of knockout mouse strains characterized by IMPC centres. Next to it is a numerical summary organised
 by gene and a download button to allow users to obtain spread sheets of the data. All data is automatically updated with each data release.
<br/>

<h4>Goals and Procedures</h4>
<p>
The second module contains information about the goals of the IMPC for embryonic phenotyping and the procedures used. Links to related grants funded to perform
in depth phenotyping of IMPC embryonic lethal strains are included.

<h4>Two-dimensional imaging</h4>
<p>The next module contains a summary of the 2-D imaging performed on IMPC embryonic lethal and subviable strains. Links are provided to thumbnail galleries
that are updated with each data release.

<h4>Three-dimensional imaging</h4>
<p>
Three-dimensional imaging- This module provides links to 3-D embryo imaging data using micro-CT and OPT technologies. Refer to the previous section for more about
the interactive embryo viewer.

<h4>Vignettes</h4>
<p>
This module captures vignette summaries of embryonic lethal and subviable mouse strains deemed interesting by IMPC developmental biologists.
The left and right arrow heads scroll to individual vignettes. Clicking on the "Full Analysis" button at the end of the summary will take you to
a more detailed vignette module (example next page)...

<h4>
Detailed vignette
</h4>
<p>
This view obtained by clicking on the "Full Analysis"" button from the vignette summaries contains a text description curated by IMPC biologists,
links to relevant data contained in the IMPC database, and annotated images that provide additional information. Users can scroll up and down this
page to see other detailed vignettes. To return to the Embryo Landing page, users will use the browser's back button.

<h4>
Embryo Phenotyping Pipeline
</h4>
<p>
The last module contains a graphical representation of the embryo phenotyping pipeline. Clicking on the image will take users to the IMPReSS
resource that contains all the standardized protocols used the by the IMPC including those for embryo phenotyping.
