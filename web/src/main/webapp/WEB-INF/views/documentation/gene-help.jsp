                                        is available (i.e. from EuroPhenome). Genes with "legacy data available" may have IMPC data available as well.

                            <p>The section starts with a summary of phenotype top level terms for this gene, with associated counts. The counts indicate the number of calls for
                            		the current gene, grouped by zygosity, sex and top level MP term. The icons on the right hand side show a visual summary of the same data. </p>
                            <p>Because MP terms may have more than one high level parent, the counts in the summary may not equal the total number of entries in the table.</p>

                                In the table displayed on our page entry lines are collapsed based on sex. That is, if for 2 lines all fields are identical except the gender, they will be shown together for a better user experience.
                                In the export file however we export all lines separately, to allow easier further processing of the data. This holds for both XLS and TSV files.

In order to be marked Complete, 7 males and 7 females must complete all core screens required by the IMPC pipeline.
