    <div>Firts, click on the "Phenotypes" datatype tab. It will show all the mouse phenotypes that IMPC knows about if no filters are ticked on the left panel.<br>
            You could enter a human or mouse phenotype (either by text or by ID) into the main input box and/or click on a filter (all top level mouse phenotype ontology terms) on the left panel to narrow down your result to relevant phenotype(s).
            <p>The screenshot below shows searching phenotypes containing the word "glucose":<br>

          The filters on the left are grayed out if they are not related to your search.<br><br>
