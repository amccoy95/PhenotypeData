                                <p> Historically the role of sex in many areas of biological research has been overlooked.
                                Systematic reviews of research studies involving animals identified a vast over-representation of male
                                animals and where two sexes were considered, two-thirds of the time the results were not analysed by sex <sup>1-3</sup>.
                                The observations that many human diseases exhibit some sex differences in prevalence, course, severity and
                                drug reaction has led to a growing concern over the imbalance in biomedical research <sup>4-6</sup>. </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p> The scale of IMPC provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of sex on a phenotype. To this end, we have been developing and
                                validating a bespoke set of analysis pipelines to assess the role of sex.  This has been run as a standalone analysis
