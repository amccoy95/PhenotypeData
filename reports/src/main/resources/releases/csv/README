This directory contains a set of purpose-built reports that are not intended for general use. For general-use reports,
please see the "reports" directory.

This directory contains a dump of all the genotype to phenotype
associations using the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology calculated
from the statistical analysis (using the PhenStat R package).

Please note that all associations are computed again for every release.

There are 5 files:

1) All legacy lines MP calls from the former EuroPhenome project in

    EuroPhenome_genotype_phenotype.csv.gz


2) All legacy lines MP calls from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Programme in

    MGP_genotype_phenotype.csv.gz


3) All current IMPC lines MP calls

    IMPC_genotype_phenotype.csv.gz

4) All current 3I lines MP calls

    3I_genotype_phenotype.csv.gz

5) All current lines MP calls (Aggregate of files 1-4)

    ALL_genotype_phenotype.csv.gz
